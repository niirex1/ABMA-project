# ABMA Project: Enhancing Smart Contract Security

## Overview

The Adaptive Bayesian Metamorphic Assessment (ABMA) introduces a revolutionary approach for enhancing the security of blockchain-based smart contracts. By integrating Bayesian Inference Models with Metamorphic Testing, ABMA stands out as a dynamic and adaptable solution for identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities in smart contracts.

## Key Features

- **Innovative Framework**: Combines Bayesian inference with Metamorphic Testing for comprehensive smart contract security assessment.
- **Probabilistic Approach**: Employs Bayesian models to effectively manage the uncertainties in vulnerability detection, with a focus on high-risk issues like reentrancy attacks.
- **Dynamic Testing**: Integrates Metamorphic Testing to adapt to evolving smart contract functions, ensuring relevance and accuracy.
- **Empirical Validation**: Validated through analysis of 21,116 real-world smart contracts, demonstrating superior performance and real-world applicability.

## Repository Contents

1. **Data Preprocessing Scripts**: Tools and algorithms used for the initial processing of smart contract code, transforming raw data into a format ready for detailed analysis.

2. **Feature Selection Algorithms**: Scripts implementing Bayesian probabilistic techniques to identify and select key features in smart contracts that are indicative of potential vulnerabilities.

3. **Classification and Metamorphic Testing Scripts**: Components that combine the insights from feature selection with dynamic metamorphic testing methodologies. This includes mechanisms for classifying contracts based on their vulnerability profiles and identifying zero-day vulnerabilities.

4. **Bayesian Inference and Dynamic Adaptation**: A suite of scripts that leverage Bayesian inference for vulnerability assessment and dynamically adapt the testing approach based on emerging data and patterns in smart contract behavior.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python (version 3.8 or higher)
- Git (for cloning the repository)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/niirex1/ABMA-project.git
   ```
2. Install required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the main script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage Instructions

1. **Load Smart Contract Source Code**: Begin by importing or loading the source code of the smart contract you wish to analyze.

2. **Execute Data Preprocessing Scripts**: Run the data preprocessing tools to transform the raw smart contract code into a structured format that is suitable for in-depth analysis.

3. **Run Feature Selection Algorithms**: Use the feature selection scripts to apply Bayesian probabilistic techniques. This will help in identifying critical features in the smart contract that may indicate vulnerabilities.

4. **Perform Classification and Metamorphic Testing**: Execute the scripts for classification and metamorphic testing. This process involves classifying the contracts into different vulnerability categories and applying dynamic testing methodologies to uncover potential security issues, including zero-day vulnerabilities.

5. **Apply Bayesian Inference and Dynamic Adaptation**: Finally, utilize the Bayesian inference scripts for a detailed vulnerability assessment. Update the Bayesian model dynamically based on the outcomes of the metamorphic testing to ensure the model remains accurate and adapts to new patterns and data.
