# Overview

ABMA is a cutting-edge approach designed to enhance the security of blockchain-based smart contracts. Utilizing a novel integration of Bayesian Inference Models and Metamorphic Testing, ABMA offers a dynamic and adaptable solution for detecting and mitigating vulnerabilities in smart contracts.

## Key Features:

- **Innovative Framework**: ABMA introduces a unique blend of Bayesian inference and Metamorphic Testing for smart contract security assessment.
  
- **Probabilistic Approach**: Employs a hierarchical Bayesian model to manage the inherent uncertainties in vulnerability detection.
  
- **Dynamic Adaptability**: Utilizes Metamorphic Testing and Dynamic Bayesian Updating to ensure the model evolves with new data and insights.

## Repository Contents:

1. **Bayesian Inference Model**: Scripts for constructing and evaluating the hierarchical Bayesian model for smart contract vulnerabilities.

2. **Metamorphic Testing**: Implementation of Metamorphic Testing techniques to generate meaningful test cases for smart contracts.

3. **Dynamic Bayesian Updating**: Mechanisms for updating the Bayesian model based on the outcomes of Metamorphic Testing.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python (version 3.8 or higher)
- Git (for cloning the repository)

## Installation:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/ABMA.git
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Navigate to the repository and run the main script:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage:

1. Load your smart contract source code.
2. Run the Bayesian Inference Model script to assess the likelihood of vulnerabilities.
3. Execute the Metamorphic Testing script to generate test cases.
4. Apply the Dynamic Bayesian Updating script to update the model based on test outcomes.

We welcome contributions from the community! Whether you're fixing bugs, improving documentation, or proposing new features, your efforts and expertise are appreciated. Here's how you can contribute:

### 1. **Fork the Repository**

Start by forking the [ABMA repository(https://github.com/your_username/ABMA)].

### 2. **Clone Your Fork**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/ABMA.git
cd ABMA
```

### 3. **Create a New Branch**

It's best practice to create a new branch for each feature or fix:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your_feature_name
```
or
```bash
git checkout -b fix/your_fix_name
```

### 4. **Make Your Changes**

- Ensure your code adheres to the project's coding standards.
- If you're adding a feature, make sure to also add relevant tests and documentation.
- If you're fixing a bug, ensure the bug is reproducible with a test before you fix it.

### 5. **Commit Your Changes**

Keep your commit messages clear and descriptive:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add a brief description of your changes"
```

### 6. **Push to Your Fork**

```bash
git push origin feature/your_feature_name
```

### 7. **Submit a Pull Request (PR)**

Go to your fork on GitHub and click the **"New pull request"** button. Fill in the necessary details and submit.

### 8. **Address Review Comments**

Maintainers will review your PR. Address any comments or feedback they provide to ensure timely merging of your contributions.

### Additional Guidelines:

- **Issue First**: For significant changes, it's best to open an issue for discussion before diving into coding.
- **Stay Updated**: Ensure your fork is always updated with the main branch to avoid merge conflicts.
- **Documentation**: Update the README or other documentation if necessary.
- **Testing**: Ensure your code passes all tests and doesn't introduce new bugs.
- **Respect Code Style**: Follow the coding style and conventions used throughout the project.
